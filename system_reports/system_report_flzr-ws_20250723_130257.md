It appears that you have a large number of PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) in your Kubernetes cluster, and some of them are terminating due to unhealthy components. To help you troubleshoot this issue, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a detailed system report with actionable steps:

1. **Identify the problematic PVCs:** From the output you provided, it seems that all your PVCs are terminating due to unhealthy components. However, if you want to focus on specific PVCs, you can use the following command to list all PVCs and their status:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -o wide
```

2. **Investigate the cause of unhealthy components:** To determine why these PVCs are terminating, you should examine the events associated with each problematic PVC. You can use the following command to view events for a specific PVC:

```bash
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name> | grep Events
```

3. **Analyze logs:** Examine the logs of the pods associated with these problematic PVCs to identify any errors or issues that might be causing the unhealthy state. You can use the following command to view the logs for a specific pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

4. **Create a system report:** After investigating each problematic PVC and identifying potential issues, compile your findings into a detailed system report. Include the following information in your report:

   - A list of all problematic PVCs with their status, namespace, storage class, and associated pods (if applicable)
   - The cause of the unhealthy state for each PVC (e.g., errors found in logs or events)
   - Recommended actions to resolve the issues and bring the PVCs back to a healthy state (e.g., updating deployments, modifying storage classes, or troubleshooting specific components)

5. **Implement solutions:** Once you have your system report, implement the recommended actions to resolve the issues with the problematic PVCs. Monitor the cluster and PVCs to ensure that they return to a healthy state after implementing the changes.
